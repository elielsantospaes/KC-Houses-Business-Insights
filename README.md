## Abstract
The aim of the project is to define the best transactions opportunities within the portfolio. To find what houses should be bought, two approach were taken. First, a general comparison between houses with same condition and same region was done. With this approach the estimated profit was, in average, from 15% up to 65%. The second approach takes the effects of the houses features to refine the analysis trying to find high profitable opportunities. Based in the houses features, 10 hypothesis were checked, and for the validated hypothesis the estimated profit, in average, was 25%. Was found the 91% of the houses are in condition 3 and 4. That shows the people preference, and trading with those houses will be easier. Houses built after 2010 are all in condition 3, but the price can be higher than houses built before, even in better condition, what can generate good trade opportunities.
